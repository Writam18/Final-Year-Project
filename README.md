## Smart Home Automation Domotics Electronics System

This Projectâ€™s objective is to provide a centralized system from which a user can control and manage home electrical devices such as lamps, appliances, cameras or sensors. To provide these functionalities the system includes a cloud server, an Android application, and an administration web application.

The System allows the user to control the devices directly by sending commands to them, e.g., turn on a lamp either by toggling a button in the Android App or by sending voice commands. The System also provides a voice assistant named scratches which can interact with users and also can use a lot of Google APIs to perform tasks like searching location on Map, setting up plans in calendar, playing songs in YouTube.

The System always uses Facial Recognition System to authenticate the user. Facial Recognition System works by comparing selected facial features from a user face image with faces stored in the database by analyzing patterns based on the user's facial feature and shape.

The cloud server connects the electric devices to the android application, and offers an interface over the Internet via Web Services. This cloud server also handles the trigger generated by the user and performs the required action.
